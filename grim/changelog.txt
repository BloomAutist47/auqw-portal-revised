Grimoire 3.8+ (05-08-19):
- Restart command when AFK. This feature will restart current command if your character is AFK
- Anti Bot-Killer. This feature will ensure your character is in right place before attacking monster, to enable this feature you just need to add MoveToCell or Join command (that two command will save your attacking location) and if your character isnt in that location, the bot will move you to that location
- New way for moving and deleting command. This feature allow you to move a command by using CTRL + (Arrow) and delete a command by using CTRL + Delete, this feature will help you to rearrange the bot easily
- Move character when changing pad boxlist(top-right corner)
- Spammer Variabel. This feature allow you to using defined variable for making spammer packet, currently this bot have 2 defined variable namely {ROOM_ID} and {USERNAME}. Example : to join a map you can write "%xt%zm%cmd%1%tfer%{USERNAME}%MAPNAME%"
- Find and join public glitched map. This feature will traverse room with room number 9999 - 9990, and if that room contains 2 player(included you) the bot will stay at that room, otherwise the bot will join a normal map, to use this feature you need to add "-Glitch" after room name in join command, example : revenant-Glitch. Unfortunatelly due to lack of algorithm this feature is not guaranteed you to find public glitched map correctly
- New combat system. This feature will allow you to do skill combo correctly if you have enough mana (lol), this feature will execute your skill command list orderly and wait untill the next skill is ready before using that skill
- Fix some typo algorithm
- Fix login message. When you entered the game with wrong account credentials the bot will stuck in Authentiaction Account Info, now its fixed
- Passing map name when you pass current cell to join command
- Client side hack plugin. This plugin will allow you to modify your gender, username, and access level to hide your credentials. This plugin work only for this version of Grimoire 3.8

- Fix join command algorithm
- Re-adjust minimum skill delay. Now you can use skill with zero delay, this mean the bot will execute next skill when its ready without delay
- New feature for finding glitched map
  Now the bot can find out glitched map in specific range, to use this you can use join command with some parameter
  example : "MapName-Glitch:Max:Min", remember that 0 < Min < Max < 32767
  there is example if i want find glitched map in range 100 - 200 : https://prnt.sc/nvqf0p
  also you can use "MapName-Glitch" with default Max = 9999 and Min = 9990

Grimoire 3.8+ (02/06/2019) :
- Fix port number. The known problem is that there are several servers that share the same IP Address so that the bot will identify that they are the same, for example: Galanoth and Sir Ver share the same IP address, so if you go to Sir Ver's server you actually enter the Galanoth server. I hope the problem is solved because i dont have an upgraded account to test it
- Add special feature for killing escherion or vath. This feature will automatically kill Staff of Inversion or Stalagbite first when they respawn again, just target the Escherion or Vath using command Kill : Monster Name, example : Kill : Vath
- Fix provoke monster. The bot will not provoke monster when the characters is dead, so i hope there is no disconnected issue because provoke monster
