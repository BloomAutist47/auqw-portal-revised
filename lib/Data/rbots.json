        "description": "If below level 75, goes to cell r4 of IceStormArena and provokes monsters in cell r3c to farm XP until level 75; make sure to join a public IceStormArena with some level 75+ players. If above level 75, goes to r3c and farms monsters directly for XP, Gold, and Class Points in all classes listed in the \"public string[] RankUpClasses = { }\" array. Feel free to add Treasure Chests to the \"public string[] RequiredItems = { }\" array if you would like the script to pick them up, and your desired equipment to the \"public string[] EquippedItems = { }\" array if you want the bot to equip that gear before farming. Have fun!"
